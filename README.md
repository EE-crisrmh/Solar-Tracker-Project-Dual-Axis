# Solar-Tracker-Project-Dual-Axis
This project is a dual-axis solar tracker built with Arduino, photoresistors (LDRs), and servo motors.  It automatically aligns a small solar panel toward the sun by comparing light levels on four sensors. The goal was to improve energy harvesting efficiency and also experiment with powering a power bank.
